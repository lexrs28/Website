I am an academic researcher studying prosocial decision-making, with a focus on blood donation behavior,
donor retention, and intertemporal altruism.

My recent publications examine who starts donating, who keeps donating, and when people prefer to
help now versus later.

## Recent Research Highlights

- **Intertemporal Altruism (2026, preprint):** In a pre-registered online experiment with 361 UK adults, most
  participants preferred earlier prosocial action, with 72% choosing earlier volunteering appointments at a
  one-month horizon and 77% at a six-month horizon.
- **Who Starts and Who Stays? (2026, preprint):** Using general population (N=1,053) and NHS Blood and Transplant
  donor data (N=2,806), I found that altruism, trust, and risk tolerance distinguish current donors from non-donors,
  while altruism and patience distinguish current from lapsed donors.

## Applied Focus

I translate these findings into practical recommendations for recruitment and retention strategy, including
trust-building messaging, risk perception framing, and appointment design that supports sustained donor commitment.
